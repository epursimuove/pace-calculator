    <h1>Purpose/background</h1>

    <p>
      The main goal from the beginning was to create an easy tool for
      calculating running paces. During the years the functionality has evolved
      to include calculations useful for other activities as well, for example
      rowing, biking, sailing and much more, but the goal is still to keep the
      user interface as simple as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      The original
      <em>NNM Pace Calculator</em> was developed from October 2002 to April 2011
      and reached version <var>4.2</var>. It was implemented in PHP.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>NNM Pace Calculator JS</em> was developed from September 2012 to
      September 2018 and reached version <var>1.3</var>. It was implemented with
      plain JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      In November 2024 version <var>5.0.0</var> of
      <em>NNM Pace Calculator</em> was introduced. It is an improvement where
      the best parts of the two previous variants are refined. Rewritten from
      scratch, implemented with Vue and Typescript and a much better responsive
      design.
